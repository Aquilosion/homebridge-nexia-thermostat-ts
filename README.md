# homebridge-nexia

This repo is a from-scratch implementation of the Homebridge interface for Nexia Thermostats.

Reading works for the most parts. Sometimes HomeKit doesn't like the updates eventhough HomebridgeUI seems to be fine with them. 

Current state:
- Reading mostly works
- Writing is broken, no idea why URLs are returning 404s.
